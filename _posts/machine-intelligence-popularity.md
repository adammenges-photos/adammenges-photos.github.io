title:      On the Subject of Machine Intelligence Popularity
date:       2015-07-16
summary:    A few folks have talked to me recently about whether or not machine learning is growing in popularity. Most are under the opinion that it's not at all, and sight things like the fact that neural networks have been around for ages, that Google's always been all about ml (PageRank for instance), etc. I decided to to dig into it a bit more, and here's the data.

A few folks have talked to me recently about whether or not machine learning is growing in popularity. Most are under the opinion that it's not at all, and sight things like the fact that neural networks have been around for ages, that Google's always been all about ml, etc. I decided to to dig into it a bit more, and here's the data.

Using hackernews as our view into the tech world (I'd say this is a pretty decent view), I've [grabbed the entire corpus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7z2l0yl3im1oxo/corpus.json?dl=0) via their api, and also fetched the article text from each item using readibility, then searched for any terms having to do with machine intelligence, and flagged them. Below is the volume of machine intelligence posts on hackernews, weighted and normalized by their score and the number of comments.

Guess it's receving more attention after all, and that's great to see.

***This post is a work in progress, there's still so much data to go over here***
